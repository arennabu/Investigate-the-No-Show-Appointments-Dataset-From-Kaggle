    "In this project, we will be analyzing data associated with the medical appointments in Brazil and is foucsed on the question of whether or not patients showed up for their appointment. In particular, we will be interested in finding the trends among patiends with different health conditions and other factors. We will be doing data wrangling, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and draw a conclusion. "
