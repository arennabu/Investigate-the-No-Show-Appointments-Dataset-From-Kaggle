# Objective and key findings 

This Kaggle dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is foucsed on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. 

In particular, I was interested in finding the trends among patiends with different health conditions and other factors. After performing data wrangling, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis, I draw the following conclusions:

- Overall, the dataset we examined in this practise showed that the majority patients showed up at their medical appointment, with a show-up rate of 80%.
- Among them, patients who were at the age of 60 or less are observied to be more likely to show up in their medical appointment. Among the 3 health conditions we examined, patients with Hipertension had the highest number of no-shows compared to patients with other health conditions. And sending a SMS to patients led to a lower low-up rate based on our dataset.
- However, there are many limitations due to the nature of the dataset. For exmaple, the data is highly inbalanced, distribution of the variable Age is left skewed, all other variables are binary with 1 being the majority values.
